\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a convenience header for Catch2\textquotesingle{}s benchmarking. It includes {\bfseries{all}} of Catch2 headers related to benchmarking.

Generally the Catch2 users should use specific includes they need, but this header can be used instead for ease-\/of-\/experimentation, or just plain convenience, at the cost of (significantly) increased compilation times.

When a new header is added to either the {\ttfamily benchmark} folder, or to the corresponding internal (detail) subfolder, it should be added here.
